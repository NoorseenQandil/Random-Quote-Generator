# Random-Quote-Generator
Random Quote Generator in HTML CSS &amp; JavaScript

## Overview
In this project, I've created a Random Quotes Generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing exclusively on quotes attributed to Mahatma Gandhi. The generator aims to inspire and provide users with insightful and thought-provoking quotes from one of the most influential figures in modern history.
The app features a clean and intuitive user interface with various functionalities, including reading quotes, copying them to the clipboard, and sharing on Twitter.
